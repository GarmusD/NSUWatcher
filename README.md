# NSUWatcher

NSUWatcher initially was created as a reboot service for NSU2 controller if controller firmware halts. Software works on ARM Cortex CPU of UDOO board.\
Little by little NSUWatcher started to log data into database and become a server endpoint for Windows and Android applications. Also used to upload new firmware.
